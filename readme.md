This is my portfolio site which has all my projects and certificated organized in a better way.

This website is a build from a template which i got from Brad Traversy. He has an awesome playlist around which he had showed how we can sreate this website.<br>
Originally it had 4 pages:- home, work, contact and about me but i added an extra page to display my certificates and achievements.<br>
